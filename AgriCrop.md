**Note that individual data providers may provide extensions to the harmonised
data model which are specific to their implementations/ markets. Applications
should therefore be written to accept additional attributes without throwing an
error, and developers should consult implementation notes from data publishers
to see if there are any extensions available to the harmonised data models.**
